    // DIRECTIONS: This script is missing a crucial "if statement" in the Update() method.
    // Nothing in Update() needs to change, but something must be added...
    //
    // The "if statements" in OnTriggerEnter() also need to be fixed.
    //
    // The goal is that the door should open when both cubes are in the trigger zone. 
    //
    // The next Unit, Unit03, should also work the same way (door opens when both cubes enter trigger zone)
    // if you fix this script, but there's something missing in Unit03's scene as well...
